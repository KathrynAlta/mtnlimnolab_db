# Welcome! :wave: 
## Mountain limnology lab sensor database

This project has a collections of functions to compile sensor data from our YSI's and other high-frequency environmental sensors

- YSI Pro DSS is a multiparameter sonde used for depth profiling a lake in the field or taking point measurements in a stream
- YSI EXO3 is a multiparameter sonde that is deployed on a buoy and logs at a fixed depth
- PME miniDOT is a sensor that logs temperature and dissolved oxygen at a fixed depth
- Odyssey PAR is a sensor that logs photosynthetically active radiation at a fixed depth
- HOBO pendant is a sensor that logs temperature and light (as lux) at a fixed depth

## Instructions for use
* All users should 'fork' the main branch of the repository and make changes via pull requests that @BellaOleksy approves.

The 'data' folder is intentionally hidden from the repo because it is large. The source folder the Teams/Sharepoint folder with the same name 'Data'. Users will need to make sure they point to a shortcut of this folder from their machine for all of the data compilation functions.
