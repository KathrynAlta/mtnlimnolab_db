## Loch Vale Water Chemistry Sensitivity Analysis

##### What trends exist within the data? Do these trends changed based on sampling frequency?  
Examining all post-1995 data for all major ions and parameters using both a linear and general additive model.    

Are major ions increasing in concentration in a linear manner over time? 

Are there certain months in which said increase in linear? 

Is a general additive model representative of the trend within the data?
