#adding new column for NO3_calc - overriding the if_else statement in the original excel file.
#AK and IAO found an issue in the Excel formula

#quick notes on sampling below, can move elsewhere -AGK
  #sampling in 1981 is weekly through october, resumes in may 1982 - weekly throughout most of 1982
  #no sampling in jan, march, oct, or nov 1983 - weekly otherwise
  #sampling is at least monthly in 1984, weekly through the open-water period, no sampling in nov 1984
  #no sampling in feb-march or dec of 1985, at least monthly outside of that
  #no sampling in feb, oct, or dec 1986, sampling is weekly through the open water period
  #nearly complete weekly sampling through 1987 and 1988
  #no sampling between march and august 1989
  #weekly sampling begins in 1991
